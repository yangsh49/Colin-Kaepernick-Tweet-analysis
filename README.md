Analyzing tweets collected involving the event of Nike endorse Colin Kaepernick on its 30th anniversary of its #JustDoIt campaign

This project mainly focus on analyzing tweets collected involving the event of Nike endorse Colin Kaepernick on its 30th anniversary of its #JustDoIt campaign, which was also comment by president Donald Trump. The purpose of the project is to analyze relevant twitter user’s general emotion and attitude towards Nike, Donald Trump, and Colin Kaepernick and their relevant social network connection. The data is obtained from the website Kaggle.

I did a social network analysis to show the correlation. From the social network, I find out that Nike, Donald Trump as well as Colin Kaepernick are among the top three influential users. 

What’s more, I did a regression analysis and hope to know which kind of variables might have an impact on the result. The results shows that turning on the geographic location, the number of retweet will more than double. In addition, tweets from a new registered user are more likely to be retweeted.
